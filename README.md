# GIST604B Open Source GIS
### Course starts: October 15, 2020
### Course ends: December 9, 2020

## WELCOME!

Greetings from GIST 604B, Open Source GIS! I'm Aaryn Olsson, the instructor for this course. 

### About Me
I am a software engineer at Planet LabsÂ where I help build analytic products with 3-5 meter imagery taken of the entire earth every single day (See this great visualization!). Besides teaching this course, I moonlight with the Arizona-Sonoran Desert Museum in the regional fight against buffelgrass. Formerly, I spent 3.5 years with Boundless Spatial, a company that specialized in development and consulting around open source geospatial software (seems relevant). Going back in time: I've worked at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, Northern Arizona University, and spent many years at the University of Arizona where I received my PhD. in Arid Lands Resource Sciences. I have four kids, love to run trails, and travel with my family.

This course is a brief introduction to a number of open source GIS software applications and tools as well as an introduction to the philosophy of open source. Students entering this class already have a strong foundation in the principles of GIS but their experiences may be limited to a small number of commercial GIS software providers. The aim of this class is to expose students to alternative technologies and methodologies for practicing GIS and give them the experience to objectively evaluate open source alternatives for both geospatial and non-geospatial applications as they pursue their careers.

### COVD-19 Update on Flex In-Person ###
***This class will NOT be part of the October 12 on-ramp of In-Person instruction***

The class meeting days and times will be held in a Live Online format until physical class meetings begin. Please review the class meeting pattern details and class format descriptions below. 

Visit https://covid19.arizona.edu/updates for more updates.
**Important Information Fall 2020 - Flex In Person**

This class will be structured to allow students to participate via a mix of in-person and online modes. The exact mix of in-person and online components will be determined by the instructor. Students should check the D2L course site for guidance from the instructor prior to attending the class in-person.

Students should be available during all scheduled class meetings and follow all health and safety guidelines. Some components of this class will be offered in a classroom setting, modified for physical distancing and enhanced disinfectant routines.  Students will be required to wear face coverings at all times when in the classroom.  

Students who need to miss a class, or series of classes, due to illness or the need to quarantine/isolate are responsible for emailing their course instructor, with copy to the Dean of Students at DOS-deanofstudents@email.arizona.edu, to let them know of the need, as soon as possible. There is no need for a medical excuse to be provided for absence of up to a week.  Students are responsible for completing any work that they might miss due to illness, including assignments, quizzes, tests and exams.

### A note on D2L and GitHub
To be compatible with existing U of A infrastructure and protocols I will handle grades and some limited communication through *D2L* but the majority of the online interaction in this class will involve two different web services: *Slack* and *GitHub*. As a complement to in-class discussion, Slack will be used for chat as well as synchronous and asynchronous collaboration while GitHub will be used to handle assignments and interactions around assignments with the instructor.

### Getting Started
You may wonder how to get started. If you login to D2L you will find things a bit bare (The Syllabus is linked there but its home is https://github.com/ua-gist604b-spring-2020/syllabus). You have two initial setup steps to get configured to use the class:

1) Sign up for Slack with [this link](https://join.slack.com/t/uagist/shared_invite/enQtNTI1MjMzNzAxOTA3LTM2ZmRmOTY0ZTk1YTRkOWEyYWNlN2Q2OTkxZDkzMzViODYyYTdiNWRmZTFiYzA5MTk0MWNiOWI5ZWE5ZTYwOTk)

2) Create a GitHub.com account if you do not already have one with [this link](https://github.com/join). 

3) Review this GitHub repository:
  - https://github.com/ua-gist604b-spring-2020/syllabus
  You will see that it contains three files:
    - this document: [README.md](README.md) 
    - the syllabus: [syllabus.md](syllabus.md)
    - the class schedule: [schedule.md](schedule.md)

4) Review the syllabus

5) Review the schedule

6) Accept your first assignment. 
- In the [schedule.md](schedule.md), see the link for `Accept`. This will take you to a `GitHub Classroom` website where you can `Accept this assignment`. When you accept the assignment, a new GitHub repository containing your first assignment will be created under your GitHub account. Feedback on your assignment will be provided through the assignment GitHub repository. However, when you turn in your assignment, your grade will be posted to D2L.
