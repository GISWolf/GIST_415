# Assignment: GIST 604B Class Project
## Worth: 100 points

## Background
This class gives you the opportunity to explore a number of different open source GIS programs but only at a rudimentary level. Additionally, the assignments are largely cookie-cutter labs aimed to give you exposure to what exists rather than requesting you master specific tools or techniques. Given also that you have unique talents and interests, the class project gives you the opportunity to take a problem that the class does not address or for you to explore an open source GIS software project that the class does not address and conduct a geospatial analysis of your choice. You can use your own data, software, and methods.

### General approach

Your project should address one or more issues from the following list using open source GIS software of your choice:
- Automation
- Projections
- Data cleaning/integrity
- Spatial/statistical summarization
- Stratified sampling
- Remote Sensing
- Network Analysis
- Mobile GIS
- WebGIS
- Compatibility with commercial software
- LiDAR
- Cartography
- Predictive modeling (e.g., habitat suitability, home range analysis)
- Geostatistics or Interpolation
- Spatial Autocorrelation
- Demographics
- Watershed analysis

### Scope of project
The scope of this project is left somewhat nebulous. If you are working with software we have used in this class, the work should be a significant extension beyond what is addressed in the class. Notably, I prefer the project not to be focused on work similar to what we've done so far. On the other hand, if you are working with software not addressed in this class (e.g., Leaflet.js, Fusion, MapServer, MySQL Spatial, uDig), then the project is not expected to be as complex. The general idea is that the project should have roughly the same complexity as one of the 40+ point assignments in this class. 

The project will be worth more points, however, because there will be 1) a proposal, 2) a progress report, 3) a final report, and 4) a 3-minute lightning talk presentation (video). 

### Examples
- Perform watershed analysis in QGIS
- Automate OSM data download and processing
- Publish a WMTS using MapServer
- Spatial analysis of GDELT data
- Use Maxent to build a habitat suitability model
- Land cover classification in QGIS
- 3D Building map of U of A
- Create fantasy maps generated in R
- Sea level rise map in uDig
- Build an address geocoder in PostGIS
- Canopy height and bare earth model of Summerhaven using LiDAR

### Process
This assignment is broken into 4 parts:
1) Project Proposal (Week 2) - 25 pts
2) Status Update (Week 3) - 25 pts
3) Final Report (Week 4) - 25 pts
4) Lightning Talk (Week 5) - 25 pts

## Assignment (Part 1) 
### Project Proposal

Please discuss your ideas for a project with me in class, over slack, or over email before completing this step to make sure the scope of your project is appropriate. The instructions are left vague to give you flexibility in choosing a project but it should not be too difficult or too simple. Discussing your proposal with me will help avoid dead-ends or pitfalls with this project.

Submit a project proposal detailing:
1. Problem Statement
2. Objective
3. Methods
 i. Data to be used
 ii. Software to be used
 iii. General approach (e.g., algorithms, techniques, tools)

I will work with you to refine your proposal.
 
## Assignment (Part 2)
### Project Status Update

Within a week of acceptance of your project proposal you should have made significant progress on your project, including acquiring any data, installing any necessary software, pre-processing data, initial analysis, etc. Specifics will vary, of course, but you should aim to have a proof of concept completed.

In your update, describe your updated workflow, including any issues or dead-ends you've encountered, the data you have worked with, its provenance, any data processing, analysis, maps or other interim products. Consider checking in any files, scripts, or screenshots in your branch, though try to be organized and be sure to reference the files in your `update.md` file. Be sure to describe any changes from the original proposal or what you anticipate to submit in your final report. 

## Assignment (Part 3)
### Final Report

Please submit your final report as a MarkDown document as a Pull request to the Class Project assignment. The format of the final report may vary depending on your topic. If you need a template to follow, use: (Abstract-Background-Methods-Results-Discussion-Conclusion). 

## Assignment (Part 4)
### Lightning Talk

Create a 3-minute video of a narrated slideshow or demo of your project. Be sure to describe the problem you are addressing, the software and data you are using, any lessons learned, and any future work that could follow where you left off.
