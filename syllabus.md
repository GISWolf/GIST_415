# GIST 604B 
## Open Source Geographic Information Systems
## University of Arizona
## March 16, 2020, to May 6, 2020

### Instructor: Dr. Aaryn Olsson 
### Email: aaryn@email.arizona.edu

## Course Description
In this course you will learn about the open source software paradigm including how open source software is developed, released, and maintained. You will be introduced to three core open source GIS software technologies: QGIS, PostGIS, Geoserver, and OpenLayers

## Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes
You will understand the Open Source software development philosophy and have basic knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
You will be comfortable checking out projects from a Git repo, creating branches, reviewing changes, and issuing merge requests.
You will know and have experience using the primary OGC Standard protocols for serving and consuming vector and raster data: WMS and WFS.
You will be comfortable using QGIS for loading, symbolizing, and processing data from files, spatial databases, and OGC services.
You will be able to perform table joins and spatial joins in QGIS to combine spatial and tabular data.
You will be able to write a simple query or function using PyQGIS.
You will be comfortable performing basic administration of geoserver, including connecting data stores, creating/deleting layers, setting rendering styles on layers, creating layer groups, and using the WMS/WFS examples to generate example OGC queries.
You will be able to visualize data stored in PostGIS, geoserver, and shapefiles 
You will have foundational knowledge and experience using PostGIS.
You will be able to write basic PostGIS queries with the assistance of postgis.net and other docs.
You will be able to create a webpage containing interactive GIS maps that allow you to add/edit/remove data, switch data sources, and a variety of complex web mapping tasks.

## Participation
This online course requires online participation through D2L, Slack, and Github. Participation in this class is designed to be somewhat deliberate to increase interaction in an online class where the students and instructor are remote and distributed. While the intent of this class is that online participation will flow naturally, there is a graded portion of this class in which online participation is measured. Each week there will be a minor but specific participation assignment.

As it is a course about Open Source, we will emphasize the open source tools or practices where possible, although ultimately we are bound by the U of A and you will be receiving official grades through d2l. 

## Slack
[Slack](https://slack.com/) is an online collaboration hub through which we will maintain ongoing chats and interactions
about the class. The `MS-GIST` Slack workspace has a channel, `#604b-osgeo` to facilitate online communication.

## GitHub
[GitHub](https://github.com) is a cloud-based code repository and collaborative development suite. You will need to create
an account if you do not already have one. Separately, an invitation will be sent to your U of A email address that will
grant you access to a GitHub Organization for this class.

## Required Text: 
None

## Grading:
90-100% A
80-90% B
70-80% C
60-70% D
<60% F

## Attendance Policy
Participation is required for all online course modules. Your participation is crucial to your
success and the success of others in your cohort. Absences pre-approved by the UA Dean of
Students (or Dean’s designee) will be honored with advanced notice to the instructors. All
holidays or special events observed by organized religions will be honored for those students
who show affiliation with that particular religion. Notify your instructor(s) prior to your absence.

## Accessibility and Accommodations
It is the University’s goal that learning experiences be as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability or pregnancy, please let me know immediately so that we can discuss options. You are also welcome to contact Disability Resources (520-621-3268) to establish reasonable accommodations. For additional information on Disability Resources and reasonable accommodations, please visit http://drc.arizona.edu/. If you have reasonable accommodations, please plan to meet with me by appointment or during office hours to discuss accommodations and how my course requirements and activities may impact your ability to fully participate.

## Student Code of Academic Integrity
